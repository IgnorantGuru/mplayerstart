README for mplayerstart


OVERVIEW
========

mplayerstart is a wrapper script for mplayer - it adds the ability to
resume video and audio playback from a saved position, send video output
to another display, disable the screensaver during playback (X, KDE3, KDE4,
and Gnome screensavers), and restore volume levels when resuming.
